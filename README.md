# humbleOS Personas

**Free. Flexible. Forever.**

A modular, community-driven system of developer personas for [humbleOS](https://github.com/yourusername/humbleOS)—a humble, beautiful Linux distribution built on Arch.

## What is humbleOS Personas?

humbleOS Personas is a **curated collection of developer toolkits** that allows new and experienced Linux users to quickly set up their perfect development environment. Instead of a bloated "everything kitchen sink" OS, users select their role(s), and get exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less.

✅ **Multi-Select** – Combine personas (e.g., Full Stack + DevOps)  
✅ **Zero Bloat** – Only essential tools and frameworks  
✅ **Community-Driven** – Submit new personas or improve existing ones  
✅ **Arch-Native** – All packages from official Arch repos and AUR
